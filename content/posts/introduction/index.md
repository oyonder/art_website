I am a chemical engineer by education. In Turkey, where I grew up, it’s very common to study fields like engineering or medicine---these were seen as secure paths to a good job. Even though my heart was drawn to biology and the arts as a child (I loved painting and watching nature documentaries). I took the advice to study engineering, so I pursued chemical engineering.

To my surprise, I loved it! I learned so much about how everyday products are made, explored sustainable engineering practices, and delved into renewable energy research. My love for understanding things that the eyes cannot see grew even deeper, leading me to discover the fascinating world of quantum chemistry and physics. This passion eventually took me on a journey to complete a Master’s in Molecular Sciences - Spectroscopy and Simulation and a PhD in Quantum Chemistry, where I explored the intricate world of molecules.

During the COVID period, all my close friends moved out of town, and I was feeling a bit overwhelmed after finishing my PhD thesis. I decided to bring more art into my life, as it has always been a source of happiness and fulfillment for me. I started sketching again and tried out linoleum printing — a technique I first heard about from my sister, who explored it during her studies at the Faculty of Fine Arts.

I fell in love with linoleum printing — both with the creative process and the unique aesthetic it offers. On top of that, linoleum is a very sustainable material, made from renewable, plant-based components like linseed oil, wood flour, and jute.

I’m excited to have found creative energy through linoprinting and to share this journey with you. Thank you for being part of this new adventure — I can’t wait to see where it leads!
