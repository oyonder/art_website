I created this print, *Bellis perennis*, as winter was approaching. Daisies, with their vibrant blooms, announce the arrival of spring and continue to rebloom through the seasons. Their resilience is truly inspiring.

Hand-carved and printed on locally sourced paper with water-based inks.

**Size**: 15x20 cm
