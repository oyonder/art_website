Hi, I'm Özlem, a linoprint artist living in Bochum, Germany. My journey into art began after earning a PhD in theoretical chemistry and later transitioning to a more creative path. Linoprinting allows me to combine my love for precision and detail with my passion for nature and growth.

## My Philosophy

Every print I create is a celebration of the beauty in everyday life—from a delicate daisy blooming in November to the intricate patterns of birds. I believe in creating sustainably made artwork. That's why I am drawn to linocut printing. I am using water-based paints and locally sourced paper to minimize environmental impact.

## The Process

Using traditional hand-printing techniques, I craft each piece with care and dedication.
