Hi, I'm Ã–zlem, a linoprint artist living in Bochum, Germany. My journey into linoleum printing began during the COVID times. I love this technique because of how meditative it is. It allows me to share my original art prints with multiple people while each piece is still unique on its own. I choose the topics which lie close to my heart, like conservation of species or living in touch with our natural beings.

## My Philosophy

I believe in creating sustainably made artwork. That's another reason why I am drawn to linocut printing. I am using water-based inks and locally sourced paper to minimize environmental impact. I have plans to get into producing my own recycled paper and producing natural pigments. It's all in progress!

## The Process

I get possessed by an idea and start sketching. I generally start the sketch on a paper, then add details via digital drawing (especially if there are axes of symmetry, or if it needs to get flipped with respect to an axis), and finally transfer it to paper again and work the details one more time. The digital drawing allows me to play with colors, which I like. I transfer the sketch onto linoleum plate and start carving while listening to a podcast or an audio book. I mix the colors in a jar using a kitchen scale, so that I can reproduce the same color again if I need to. With a ton of excitement, I do a test print and work on the details of the composition if necessary.
