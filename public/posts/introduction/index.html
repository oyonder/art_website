<h1>From Chemistry to Creativity: My Journey to Linoprinting</h1>

Dec. 18, 2024


<br/><br/>
<p>I am a chemical engineer by education. In Turkey, where I grew up, it’s very common to study fields like engineering or medicine—these were seen as secure paths to a good job. Even though my heart was drawn to biology and the arts as a child (I loved painting and watching nature documentaries), I felt the societal pressure to choose a “safe” career. Not feeling brave enough to risk uncertainty, I pursued engineering instead.</p>
<p>To my surprise, I loved it! I learned so much about how everyday products are made, explored sustainable engineering practices, and delved into renewable energy research. My love for understanding things that the eyes cannot see grew even deeper, leading me to discover the fascinating world of quantum chemistry and physics. This passion eventually took me on a journey to complete a master’s and PhD in molecular sciences, where I explored the intricate world of molecules.</p>
<p>When I became unemployed in the summer of 2023, I felt optimistic about finding a job in renewable energy—a field I deeply care about. But things didn’t go as planned. I poured my energy into job applications, crafting personalized cover letters and revising my CV countless times. Despite my efforts, rejection after rejection came, leaving me questioning: Am I not hireable? Is it because I’m a Turkish woman living in Germany in her 30s? Some companies provided feedback, while others didn’t even respond.</p>
<p>Then, everything changed when my son was born. I was overwhelmed by the bliss of motherhood and realized that I wanted to spend as much time as possible with him during these precious early years. While my heart still aches for not being able to work in the field I trained for, I’ve decided to embrace a new chapter—one that brings me immense joy: art.</p>
<p>Art has always been a source of happiness and fulfillment for me. Now, I’m excited to channel my energy into creating linoprints and sharing my journey with you. Thank you for being part of this new adventure—I can’t wait to see where it takes us!</p>
